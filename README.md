# Object-Oriented Programming & Design- Task 4: “Pokemons” in Python

## Backround

This project presents the final (last) assignment for the OOP course.
In this assignment, we asked to “put into practice” the main tools covered along the course, in particular,expected to design a “Pokemon game” in which given a weighted graph,  a set of “Agents” that should be located on it so they could “catch” as many “Pokemons” as possible.
The pokemons are located on the graph’s (directed) edges, therefore, the agent needs to take (aka walk)  the proper edge to “grab” the pokemon (see below for more info). 
our goal is to maximize the overall sum of weights of the “grabbed” pokemons (while not exceeding the maximum amount of server calls allowed in a second - 10 max)
